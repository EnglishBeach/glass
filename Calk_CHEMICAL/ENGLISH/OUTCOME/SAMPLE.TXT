@x1       CHEMICAL THERMODYNAMICS CALCULATOR V1.10:
            HOW TO ENTER SAMPLE PROBLEM

This  file  contains  description how to create and solve simple
sample problem. To show difference between explanative text  and
strings that you type and keys you hit, both the last printed in
G4bold faceH5. The special key names enclosed in angle brackets <>.

The sample problem is formulated as follows:
   to  find equilibrium state of a system, containing 3 moles of
   diethylcadmium, 2 moles of  diethyltellurium,  0.4  moles  of
   diethylselenium,  0.6  moles of diethylsulfur and 12 moles of
   hydrogen. There  is  one  condensed  solution  consisting  of
   cadmium-tellurium,  cadmium-selenium  and  sulfur-cadmium. To
   ignore ability of formation of diamonic carbon. Do solve with
   pressure 0.015 atm and temperature  from  300  to  700  in  6
   points.

First,  start Chemical by typing G4CHH5 at DOS prompt. Press any key
twice, and you're pass into the Main menu. Highlight bar  is  on
the  "Problem" selection. Choose it by pressing the G4EnterH5 key to
go to the Problem window. Now, the cursor  is  in  the  "Problem
description" field. Hit the G4EnterH5 key and type in description of
your problem:

  G4Thermodesctruction of EOC mix in hydrogen environment<Enter>H5

Then,  press  G4<Down>H5  to  access the Temperature field and press
G4<Enter>H5. Type in the box

  G4300,6,700<Enter>H5

Press  G4<Down>H5  once  more,  passing  to  the Pressure field, hit
G4<Enter>H5 and type

  G40.015<Enter>H5

Now, you're to give out initial mix. Press G4<Down>H5 once more; the
cursor  stands  on  the  Initial mix heading. Type the following
keys:

  G4<Ins>cdc2h6:3<Enter>
  <Ins>tec2h6:2<Enter>
  <Ins>sec2h6:0.4<Enter>
  <Ins>s1c2h6:0.6<Enter>
  <Ins>h2:12<Enter>H5

Then,  you  must  exclude  the  diamond from the solving. Strike
G4<Down>H5 twice to  locate  the  cursor  on  the  Excluded  species
heading. Type:

  G4<Ins>*c[Diamond]<Enter>H5

Now you're to  enter  the  solid solution from your problem. Hit
G4<down>H5 twice again to place cursor on the Solid solution heading. Type

  G4<Ins>cdte<Enter>H5

Hit G4<Down>H5 to locate cursor on the formula CdTe, then type

  G4<Ins>cdse<Enter>
  <Ins>s1cd<Enter>H5

Now, entering your task is completed. You probably want to  save
it on the disk. Press G4<F2>H5 and type

  G4mysample<Enter>H5

Task  is  saved, and name MYSAMPLE.CHM flashes at the upper left
corner of the Problem  window.  Now,  you  can  load  your  task
anytime you want it.

Now,  it's time to solve this problem. For instance, you want to
limit C-chain length to 3 atoms. Pass  into  the  Main  menu  by
hitting  G4<F10>H5,  then  type  G4OSCH5  to access the "C-chain length"
choice and type in

  G43<Enter>
  <Esc><Esc>H5

to change the default value to 3.

Now,  you're in the Main menu. Start solving by typing G4SH5. First,
Chemical searches the database for species that may  be  created
in  the  system, then the Solving window appears, where it shows
how it  solves  your  problem.  After  all,  you  will  see  the
Refinement  points  menu. Remember this point since we will have
to return to it. Now, you need no refinement since you're  going
to   print  results  of  solution.  Refinement  will  incredibly
increase number of points and, respectively, amount of printing.
So, type G4<Esc>DH5 to refuse  refining,  then  hit  G4<F9>H5.  Chemical
passes into the Result menu without doing any refinement.

Load  printer with paper, and choose the "Print" option from the
menu. Else one menu appears. We will not work  with  the  second
choice,  "Print options". We just simply start typing by hitting
the G4EnterH5 key. Printer brings out short one-page report. At this
point, you want to print graphics as well. To print high-quality
graphics, you must refine your solution in  several  points  per
each  interval.  To  do  it,  we  repeat  solving  from the very
beginning.

Choose  the "Abandon" option by hitting G4AH5 and confirm abandoning
by hitting G4YH5. Touch G4SH5 while in the Main menu, and Chemical again
brings you up again into the Refinement points menu. Now,  since
you're  making presentation quality graphics, you want to refine
all points. Post it by hitting G4<Esc>RH5, then hit  G4<F9>H5.  Chemical
allows  you  to  change the default number of refinement points.
Since you're agree with it, you simply press  G4<Enter>H5.  Chemical
does  refinement  (it  is  severally  longer  than  the  primary
solving) and shows the Result menu again.

Here, change significance level to 1E-11. To do it, type G4SH5, then

   G41E-11<Enter>H5

Then,  look  graphics by pressing G4GH5. You now see the Solid page,
where separate solid phases and condensed  solution  are  drawn,
the first by white lines and the second by yellow ones. To print
this  graphic,  hit  G4<F9>H5.  After  printing  is  finished, touch
G4<Space>H5 to change page to Vapor one, where you see Vapor  phase.
Print  it  also by pressing G4<F9>H5. To leave the Graphics service,
press G4<Esc>H5. Touch G4AYH5, and you're back in the Main menu.

Now,  let's  change  our  problem. What will change if we fix up
concentration  of  diethylsulfur  at  50%  level  from   initial
concentration  and  announce that the concentration of ethane is
two times high than the concentration of methane? (Usually, such
information comes from real experiment). Surely,  we  must  edit
the problem that is already in the Problem window.

Go  into  the Problem window again by typing G4PH5. Place the cursor
on the Fixed species heading ant type

   G4<Ins>s1c2h6<Enter>H5

The  second  condition  from  the  problem must be considered as
follows: the  concentration  of  methane  times  two  minus  the
concentation of ethane equal to zero. So, enter this constraint.
Place  the  cursor  on  the Linear constraints heading and press
G4<Ins>H5. You're to enter right hand of constraint. Type in

  G40<Enter>H5

Now,  Chemical  asks  you to enter first specie from constraint.
Type

  G4c2h6:-1<Enter>
  <Down><Ins>
  ch4:2<Enter>H5

Now,  the  problem  is changed in the way we wanted. You want to
save this corrected variant to the disk. Press G4<F2>H5, and task is
saved. Note that you're not asked for name of file; since you've
once provided name for the file, it is not asked for again.

The  only  thing  that  is  remaining to do is to repeat all the
steps of solving, as in the above example.
