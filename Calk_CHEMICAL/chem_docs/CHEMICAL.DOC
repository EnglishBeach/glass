			 USING SYSTEM



3.1. INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENT

  Chemical  is  an  integrated environment. This means that once
  you invoked  Chemical  executable  file  from  DOS,  you  need
  neither  longer  invocation  of  any  other tasks nor whatever
  operation outside Chemical.

  While  working in Chemical, you always see several  windows on
  the screen. Window is a rectangular  portion  of  the  screen,
  where  some  information  is displayed. Usually, window have a
  border, which provides easy concentration of attention to  the
  window.  One  of windows is always active. This means that all
  your work runs in that window. All other windows are  inactive
  in this moment.

  Although   there  are  many  different  kinds  of  windows  in
  Chemical, they may be distributed into  several  types.  These
  are  Menus,  Prompts,  Error  boxes, Info boxes, Verify boxes,
  Help windows and one Problem window. In following sections all
  these types except Problem window are  described  in  details.
  The Problem window is described in section 3.###.


3.1.1 Menus

  Menu  is  a  set of variant selections. You must choose one of
  these (or no one) items while being  in  menu.  Menu  contains
  list  of  choices and highlight bar that is always pointing to
  one of choices. You can move bar either by  using  arrow  keys
  (these  are  keys  with  arrow  signs on them; you usually use
  these keys to move the cursor) or by moving mouse to the  side
  where  you  want to move highlight bar. Once you've chose item
  that you want, press Enter key or left mouse button to  select
  this  item.  If  you  change you mind and don't want to select
  anything, press Escape key or right mouse  button.  Note  that
  Esc  key  works  not  in  every  menu; in these menus you must
  certainly cull one of the selections. The F1 key brings up the
  Help window, where you can see description of  the  selection,
  on which highlight bar is currently located.


3.1.2. Prompts

  Prompt  window  allows  you  to  enter some data when Chemical
  requests them. Prompt window is 1 line high. There are cursor,
  already pointing to a first character place in the  line,  and
  often  default,  that  Chemical  had selected as most smart in
  this case. You may agree with this default by  pressing  Enter
  key, or change it. Under any circumstances, the Enter finishes
  up  editing and tells Chemical, that you have entered what you
  wanted to enter. The Esc key cancels editing in any  time  and
  tells that you don't want to enter anything.

  How to edit string? If you simply start typing, the default is
  cleared  out  and character you typed is appeared in the first
  position. If you hit any editing key, the default line changes
  its color and becomes permanent, as if you  have  entered  it.
  The  editing process description follows. Left and right arrow
  keys, as well as mouse movements, forces cursor to shift  left
  or  right.  The  Del  key deletes one character just under the
  cursor; the Backspace key rubs out one letter left to  cursor.
  The  Home key moves cursor to beginning of the line, while the
  End key moves it to the end.  Characters  that  you  type  are
  inserted  into  text  right under cursor, causing left rest of
  line to be shifted right one position. As was described above,
  Enter ends editing, Esc cancels it.

  If  after pressing the Enter key you obtain sound signal, this
  means, that line you have typed cannot be entered  because  of
  its   invalid  syntax.  The  cursor  points  the  place  where
  syntactical check failed. Correct an  error  and  press  Enter
  again in this case.

  The F1 key calls up the Help window, where the short narrative 
  is given about the thing you must enter.


3.1.3. Error boxes

  The  Error  box  appears when error of any sort have occurred.
  This box is 1 line high, and contains brief description  about
  the  trouble. More comprehensive description you may obtain in
  corresponding Help window which is called up by  pressing  the
  F1  key.  Also you can press the Esc key or right mouse button
  to remove  this  box  from  the  screen.  No  other  keys  are
  available in the Error box.


3.1.4. Info boxes

  The  Info box contains info messages, that would be useful for
  you. This may be, for example, request to  load  printer  with
  new  sheet  of paper or some information how solving is flown.
  If you are requested to press any  key  after  satisfying  the
  demand,  do  it. Any alphanumeric or functional key as well as
  any mouse button are valid there. F1 doesn't brings up a  help
  in these boxes.


3.1.5. Verify boxes

  The  Verify  box comes into sight when some action is about to
  happen, and this action may cause some damage or loss of data.
  This action is briefly described in the box. You  may  confirm
  proceeding by pressing "Y" key or cancel the action by hitting
  "N".  No  case  is  significant  there, as well as no mouse is
  working.


3.1.6. Help windows

  The  Help  window  is turned up when you're asking for help by
  pressing F1 key. It contains description of the item that  you
  are  currently  enjoying.  By  pressing the Esc key you remove
  this box from the screen.  If  help  message  is  longer  than
  window,  down  arrow  sign appears in the down right corner of
  the window. In this case you must press the PgDn key  to  show
  next  page  of  the  text.  Similarly,  the  PgUp key calls up
  previous page of the text.

  The  Help  that was described above provides information about
  logical meaning of the item. While in Help, you can hit the F1
  key once again. This opens else one Help window, where  you'll
  find  depiction  which  keys are available and what they do in
  the item from  which  the  primary  Help  window  was  called.
  Working  in  such  secondary  Help  is  completely  same as in
  primary one.
