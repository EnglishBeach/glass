@x1  CHEMICAL THERMODYNAMICS CALCULATOR V1.10: THE MATH BACKBONE

G4-1i. IntroductionH5-0

Chemical  Thermodynamics Calculator is the system for simulation
of the  chemical  engineering  processes.  It  is  the  computer
realization  of  the  most  common  method  of  solving chemical
thermodynamics problems - Gibbs method supplementing possibility
of describing both equilibrium and  non-equilibrium  states  for
multispecies heterogeneous chemically reactive systems.

Chemical is an integrated environment and provides the following
possibilities:
   þ unique,    rapid,    reliable    algorithm    for   solving
     thermodynamics problems  based  on  minimization  of  Gibbs
     energy using Lagrange method;
   þ automatic  interaction  with  the database of thermodynamic
     functions  of   individual   species   (Gibbs   energy   vs
     temperature);
   þ multiwindow  user-friendly  interface and over 150 pages of
     help;
   þ facilities  for tabulated and graphic representation of the
     solution results.

The   version  that  we  present  here  is  capable  of  solving
sufficiently common class of the problems  and  allows  to  make
calculation  of  the system actually consisting of the unlimited
number of vapor and condensed  species  considering  their  both
electroneutral  and ionized forms, separate condensed phases and
ideal mixtures. The assignment for calculation is defined by the
relative content of initial substances or by element composition
and also by temperature and pressure at one or several points.

Chemical  has  rather  effective  possibility  of simulating the
non-equilibrium  states  occurring  in  experience,   based   on
Leontovich idea about increasing the number of outer parameters.
In  this version of Chemical non-equilibrity can be described in
terms of giving out the linear constraints to the concentrations
of the selected species according to the additional experimental
information.

The  universal  algorithms  and designing principles of Chemical
suggest further development in the following ways:
   þ implementation of non-ideal solution models;
   þ describing   the  arbitrary  thermodynamic  processes  when
     assigning any permissible pair of values  from  P,V,T,U,H,S
     set;
   þ extension    of    possibilities    for    description   of
     non-equilibrium states;

G4-1ii. Mathematical basics of ChemicalH5-0

The general criterion for the determination of the thermodynamic
state  of  multispecies  heterogeneous  system  is  its  entropy
maximum 4[1]5. The formulation of the problem  for  a  widely-used
practical case of the fixed temperature T and pressure P 4([2,3])5
resulting  from this criterion is reduced to the minimization of
Gibbs energy in the following equation

            G(T,P,{nS1iT})/RT=G4äH5nS1iT(æ~S1iT+G4lnH5nS1iT)-G4äH5n~S1fTG4lnH5n~S1fT             4(1)5

where  nS1iT  is the desired numbers of moles of the specie i, n~S1fT -
numbers to be determined by solving the problem as mole  numbers
in the phase f.

The equation 4(1)5 is written for a multiphase system, consisting,
for  instance,  of  the  ideal  vapor phase, arbitrary number of
separate (single specie) condensed phases and  predefined  ideal
condensed  solution  (mixtures).  Value  n~S1fT  for each of fS10T such
phases is defined by the equation

                  G4äH5nS1iTaS1ifT-n~S1fT=0,  f=1...fS10T                    4(2)5

where  the  belonging  coefficients  of specie i in phase f have
been introduced,  aS1ifT={0,1}.  Reduced  chemical  potentials  (ie
divided  by  RT) for each pure (individual) specie in the system
are defined by the tabulated values of  standard  Plank function
èS00T(T)=-(GS00T(T)-HS00T(0))/T and by the standard entalphy of formation

0                      ëHS00TS1fi,0T   èS00T(T)   Ú G4lnH5p~, vapor
                æ~S1iT =  ÄÄÄÄÄÄ - ÄÄÄÄÄ + ´                    4(3)5

where ëHS00TS1fi,0T=ëHS00TS1fi,298T-(HS00T(298)-HS00T(0))S1iT,
      p~ - dimensionless overall pressure in units of atm.

For  closed systems without any matter exchange with environment
while going from the initial to the final  thermodynamic  state,
the  most  common and useful form of law of conservation of mass
is given by expression 4[2,3]5

                  G4äH5nS1iTaS1ijT-bS1jT=0,  j=1...jS10T                    4(4)5

where bS1jT  - mole number of element j,
      jS10T  - number of different elements,
      aS1ijT - stoichiometric  matrix  coefficients, defining the
            quantity of atoms j in all forms of specie i.

In such a balance by element the latter are independent species.

Thus,  in  the Chemical's initial assignment, excepting values T
and P, one can either directly  specify  the  mole  numbers  for
element  j or Chemical itself easily calculates them from number
of moles of  initial  species  nS1iTS00T:  b'S1jT=G4äH5nS1iTS00TaS1ijT.  Unnecessary  but
convenient  normalization  of  the  initial  composition  allows
to assign the relative values while specifying the latter and to
unify the inner variables in 4(4)5 by  designating  bS1jT=b'S1jT/G4äH5b'S1kT .  It
should be noted that the overall abundance of atoms in system is
always  exactly 1 mole; since values 0ónS1iTó1 as a solution result
define the number of moles for specie i per mole-atom.

This stage terminates the traditional formulation of the problem
4[2,3]5, and equations  4(1)5-4(4)5  define completely the equilibrium
of the  system,  which  is  achieved  due  to  the  inner  phase
and chemical conversion.

However,  in  the  real  various reactions indicated conversions
don't proceed to  the  end.  As  a  consequence  system  reaches
so-called incomplete equilibrium. In particular, if one or a few
species under given  conditions  are  kinetically  stable,  then
while  calculating  such  a  state  it  is possible to fix their
concentrations at the level defined by  additional  experimental
information.

In  a  more general case the kinetic constraints both for phases
and for chemical conversions are formulated in the thermodynamic
terms as qualitative features of the system  to  be  considered.
It's practically effected by:
   1) dividing   the    system    into   subsistems  with  their
      own relaxation times;
   2) prohibition  the  chemical conversion for substances which
      are in fact inert under given conditions;
   3) assumption  of  immobility  of  species  in certain parts,
      phases etc.

Similar  constraints, on the basis of which some of the possible
processes are either excluded or  certain  outer  effects  being
included,  can  be  expressed as additional equations similar to
4(4)5 in particular:

                  G4äH5nS1iTaS1ilT-bS1lT=0,  l=1...lS10T                    4(5)5

Equations  4(5)5  may  reflect  additional  energy  balance to the
isolated species in the presence of selective effects.  In  this
case  the  aS1ilT  coefficient  play the role in balance of partial
energies. For ionic systems, the aS1ilT coefficients are charges of
species, bS1lT is the overall charge of the system. For  chemically
non-equilibrium   systems   aS1ilT  are  the  coefficients  of  the
incorporation the specie i into the linear constraint l.

Such  an  approach  allows  various non-equilibrium states to be
treated as conditionally-equilibrium ones 4[5]5. In this case, the
thermodynamic functions of the system, if they  exist,   ie  are
measurable,  depend  on the larger number of arguments and outer
parameters than in equilibrium in the  same  system  4[4]5.  As  a
matter of fact, the part of the inner variables, for instance by
composition,  which are defined for solving suitable equilibrium
problem, goes over into the category of the outer ones  together
with specified T and P.

There's   a   position   4[6]5   according   to  which  stationary
non-equilibrium processes can be attributed, in number of cases,
to the category of conditionally-equilibrium ones.

The  minimization  of Gibbs energy 4(1)5 with n~S1fT values 4(2)5 in the
presence of the balance equations 4(4)5 and linear constraints 4(5)5
by using Lagrange method of indefinite multipliers results  into
equation  system 4(6)5,  where  nS1iT is determined  by the following

expressions 4(7)5:

                  G4äH5nS1iTAS1iJT-BS1JT=0,  J=1...JS10T                    4(6)5

                  nS1iT=exp(G4äH5TAS1iJTæS1JT-æ~S1iT)                         4(7)5

In  deriving 4(6)5 and 4(7)5, the formal substitution n~S1fT=exp(æS1fT) has
been    made.    The    extended     stoichiometric       matrix
AS1iJT={aS1ijT,aS1ilT,aS1ifT} and vector BS1JT={bS1jT,bS1lT,n~S1fT} have been introduced;
they allowed to unite 4(2)5, 4(4)5 and 4(5)5 into one equation 4(6)5. In
the  vector  of  unknowns  æS1JT={æS1jT,æS1lT,æS1fT} the Lagrange indefinite
multipliers æS1jT and æS1lT have a  sense  with  respectively  reduced
chemical potentials for atoms and linear constraints.

To  solve JS10T=jS10T+lS10T+fS10T nonlinear equation with the same number of
unknowns  æS1JT  Chemical  uses  unique  quasi-Newtonian  iterative
procedure  which  is  practically  insensitive  to  the  initial
estimate.

This    version   provides   ability   of   calculation   wholly
electroneutral ionic systems, as well as all possible  cases  of
linear  constraints to concentrations of any species to describe
chemically non-equilibrium states. Although fixation  of  specie
is  a  particular  case of linear constraint, it's provided with
separate procedure, which requires no knowledge of thermodynamic
functions. Note that fixation level for specie is  specified  in
percents  from  its maximal abundance. The exclusion of a specie
may be considered as fixation at the zero  level.  At  the  same
time,  always  be  sure  to  fix  electron gas only by using the
linear constraint, never direct fixing. While dealing  with  the
linear  constraints,  especially  when their right hand is other
than zero, you should be careful, since Chemical  is  unable  to
recognize   the   situation   when  linear  constraints  are  in
refutation with matter balance equations  4(6)5.  If  it  happens,
Chemical will be unable to reach the convergency you wanted.

The main steps while solving the problem in Chemical:
   þ Creating the problem in interactive mode;
   þ Automatic   retrieving   all  containing  in  the  database
     species, that can  be  formed  from  the  elements  in  the
     problem;
   þ Solving  the  4(6)5-4(7)5  system and output the results onto a
     terminal or a printer.

And,   finally,   a   few  words  about  representation  of  the
thermodynamic  functions  of  species  in  the   database.   For
dimensionless    standard    Plank    function   the   following
approximation formula is adopted:

        èS00T(T)/R = èS11T+èS12TG4lnH5x+èS13TxS0-2T+èS14TxS0-1T+èS15Tx+èS16TxS02T+èS17TxS03T        4(8)5

where  x=Tù10S0-4T,  T in K. Depending on units of measurement used
for function èS00T, gas constant  R=8.3144 J/molúK=1.9871 cal/molúK
(cal  assumed  to  be thermochemical calorie). The dimensionless

enthalpy of formation in zero K

            ëhS00T = ÄÄÄÄÄ = ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ            4(9)5
                  10S04TùR         10S04TùR2

According  to  this, the reduced chemical potentials for solving
are calculated as follows:

0                                Ú G4lnH5p~, vapor
              æ~S1iT = ëhS00T/x-èS00T/R + ´                          4(10)5
                                À 0, condensate2

Every  specie  that stored in the database, is determined by the
quantity  ëhS00T  and  seven  coefficients èS11T-èS17T  in  corresponding
temperature  ranges.  Such  a data can be found in the reference
books 4[7,8]5 or similar ones.
